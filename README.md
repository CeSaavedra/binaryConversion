# Binary Conversion Program

This program demonstrates the ability to perform fundamental input and output. It utilizes a static class to perform a mathematical algorithm. It also uses while loops to perform case sensitive validation.

The program prompts the user for an integer and displays the binary conversion of that integer. The user will then be prompted whether or not they want to try another conversion. The program validates the user's input and performs the corresponding action.
